    Use as a decorator with @Profile() or as a context manager with 'with Profile():'. Provides accurate timing
    measurements with CUDA synchronization support for GPU operations.

    Attributes:
        t (float): Accumulated time in seconds.
        device (torch.device): Device used for model inference.
        cuda (bool): Whether CUDA is being used for timing synchronization.

    Examples:
        Use as a context manager to time code execution
        >>> with Profile(device=device) as dt:
        ...     pass  # slow operation here
        >>> print(dt)  # prints "Elapsed time is 9.5367431640625e-07 s"
